Warhammer 40,000: Darktide Mod

[Nexus Mods page](https://www.nexusmods.com/warhammer40kdarktide/mods/469)

This mod contains options to remove certain decorations from loading screens. Custom Loading Background lets you add beautiful art to your loading screens (or horrifying images if that floats your boat), but I got annoyed by the random decorations of the loading screen covering up my wallpapers. Therefore, I have sentenced them to death I can bask in the glory of my wallpapers, which I've spent way too much time obsessing over...

Each loading screen contains the following elements:

- Hint text
- Skull line divider
- Prompt for next hint text
- Spinning skull icon (Also disables skull during mission loading! Not disabled by default)
- Loading reason/status (not affected by this mod; use Remove Loading Status [RLS] or LessAnnoyingLoadingï»¿)
- Background image (not affected by this mod)
- Fade to black transitional overlay (not affected by this mod)

Of the affected elements, you can toggle which ones you want to hide in the Mod Options menu. Note that changes will not apply until the next game restart/reload. Reloading may cause other mods to function improperly, so I'd recommend simply restarting the game.

By default, I left the spinning skull on, since it makes it pretty obvious if the game has frozen. I also don't mind it covering up the mission loading screen, even though you can tell the game didn't freeze by the characters shuffling in their seats.

# Installation
Install like any other mod. The mod is load order agnostic.

See the [DMF guide](https://dmf-docs.darkti.de/#/installing-mods) for manual installation.
